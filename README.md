## Welcome to FlashcardJDA

This project has been created to help pupils of the [Jeanne d'Arc establishment](https://www.jda-argentat.fr/) to revise using flashcards.

We use the following libraries:
  * jQuery 3.4.1
  * Bootstrap v4.4.1
  * Popper.js
  * Font awesome Latest (5.12.0 at the moment)
  * Bulma v0.8.0

 > Now that we use php instead of html, you can find our website at [flashcardsjda.ovh](flashcardsjda.ovh)
